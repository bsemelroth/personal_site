    <h2>About Brody</h2>
    <p> Greetings and welcome to my personal website! I am a current senior at the Tippie College of Business at the University of Iowa. I major in Business Analytics and Information Systems. I also currently work part-time with a full-time transition upon graduation as
        a robotics process automation software engineer for Wells Enterprises. I have worked in the past as a data management intern, a student manager, and a sanitation coordinator. While studying at the university of Iowa I have been able to learn extensively about the fields of
        data, business, and programming. Some hobbies of mine include hiking, fishing, books, and gardening. My favorite thing about being a University of Iowa student is being able to support Hawkeye Sports and attend football/basketball games.
    </p>
    <h2>Future Plans and Goals</h2>
    <p> I will graduate with a BBA majoring in Business Analytics and Information Systems in May of 2022. I will also start full-time in my role as a robotics process automation software engineer in May of 2022. My career will start out remote and I plan to 
        move to Des Moines, Iowa in August of 2022 with my brother and a friend. I will work from home with the occasional travel to corporate in Le Mars, Iowa. I would like to further progress my career in the field of robotics process automation and eventually 
        transition to a business of my own involving one of my outdoor hobbies some day.
    </p>
