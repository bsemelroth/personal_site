# personal_site
### This is the repository for my personal portfolio website
This repository was used to create a landing page for myself on the Internet. In addition I configured and installed Google Analytics and linked my custom 
domain I purchased. 
### Why?
This was an assignment for my Digital Product Management course my senior year of college. This website was created to help increase my web presence and to show off some HTML/CSS skills.
